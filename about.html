        <p>"In our country, true teams rarely exist... social barriers and personal ambitions have reduced athletes to dissolute cliques or individuals thrown together for mutual profit... Yet these rugby players. with their muddied, cracked bodies, are struggling to hold onto a sense of humanity that we in America have lost and are unlikely to regain. The game may only be to move a ball forward on a dirt field, but the task can be accomplished with an unshackled joy and its memories will be a permanent delight. The women and men who play on that rugby field are more alive than too many of us will ever be. The foolish emptiness we think we perceive in their existence is only our own."</p>

      <p>This is where you get to know me! Thanks again for visiting my site. Outside of my sciencing interests, I mostly enjoy outdoors activities. Whether its hiking, camping, running or biking, I'm usually up for getting up and moving around in nature. Salt Lake City is a pretty perfect place for that, so I lucked out going to graduate school here. Aside from being active, I enjoy reading, cooking, traveling, weightlifting, spontaneous dancing, and pretty much any type of cooperative or competitive game.</p>
      <p>I'm also a pretty big sports fan. Yay sports! I watch international rugby matches from time to time to reminisce about my time on the field at Vassar, since I was forced to retire due to injuries. As a New England native growing up, I am also a huge baseball and Boston Red Sox fan. I sometimes like to mess around with baseball statistics using the data analysis and visualization skills that I've developed, just for fun.<p>
